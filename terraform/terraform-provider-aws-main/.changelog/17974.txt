```release-note:note
provider: New `default_tags` argument as a public preview for applying tags across all resources under a provider. Support for the functionality must be added to individual resources in the codebase and is only implemented for the `aws_subnet` and `aws_vpc` resources at this time. Until a general availability announcement, no compatibility promises are made with these provider arguments and their functionality.
```
