```release-note:bug
 resource/aws_launch_configuration: Remove default value for `associate_public_ip_address` argument and mark as Computed. This fixes a regression introduced in [v4.17.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#4170-june--3-2022) via [#17695](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/17695) when no value is configured, whilst honoring any configured value
