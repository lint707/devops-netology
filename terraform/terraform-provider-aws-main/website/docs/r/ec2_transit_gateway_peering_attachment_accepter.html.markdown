# Resource: aws_ec2_transit_gateway_peering_attachment_accepter

Manages the accepter's side of an EC2 Transit Gateway Peering Attachment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_ec2_transit_gateway_peering_attachment_accepter" "example" {
  transit_gateway_attachment_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway_peering_attachment.example.id

  tags = {
    Name = "Example cross-account attachment"
  }
}
```

A full example of how to create a Transit Gateway in one AWS account, share it with a second AWS account, and attach a to a Transit Gateway in the second account via the `aws_ec2_transit_gateway_peering_attachment` resource can be found in [the `./examples/transit-gateway-cross-account-peering-attachment` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/transit-gateway-cross-account-peering-attachment).

The following arguments are supported:

* `transit_gateway_attachment_id` - (Required) The ID of the EC2 Transit Gateway Peering Attachment to manage.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value tags for the EC2 Transit Gateway Peering Attachment. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - EC2 Transit Gateway Attachment identifier
* `transit_gateway_id` - Identifier of EC2 Transit Gateway.
* `peer_transit_gateway_id` - Identifier of EC2 Transit Gateway to peer with.
* `peer_account_id` - Identifier of the AWS account that owns the EC2 TGW peering.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).
