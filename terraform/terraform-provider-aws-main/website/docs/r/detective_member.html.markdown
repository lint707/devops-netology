## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_detective_graph" "example" {}

resource "aws_detective_member" "example" {
  account_id                 = "AWS ACCOUNT ID"
  email_address              = "EMAIL"
  graph_arn                  = aws_detective_graph.example.id
  message                    = "Message of the invitation"
  disable_email_notification = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `account_id` - (Required) AWS account ID for the account.
* `email_address` - (Required) Email address for the account.
* `graph_arn` - (Required) ARN of the behavior graph to invite the member accounts to contribute their data to.
* `message` - (Optional) A custom message to include in the invitation. Amazon Detective adds this message to the standard content that it sends for an invitation.

* `updated_time` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, of the most recent change to the member account's status.

## Import
