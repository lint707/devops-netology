## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `file_system_id` - (Required) The ID of the EFS file system.
* `bypass_policy_lockout_safety_check` - (Optional) A flag to indicate whether to bypass the `aws_efs_file_system_policy` lockout safety check. The policy lockout safety check determines whether the policy in the request will prevent the principal making the request will be locked out from making future `PutFileSystemPolicy` requests on the file system. Set `bypass_policy_lockout_safety_check` to `true` only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent `PutFileSystemPolicy` request on the file system. The default value is `false`.
* `policy` - (Required) The JSON formatted file system policy for the EFS file system. see [Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/access-control-overview.html#access-control-manage-access-intro-resource-policies) for more info.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID that identifies the file system (e.g., fs-ccfc0d65).

## Import

The EFS file system policies can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_efs_file_system_policy.foo fs-6fa144c6
