# Resource: aws_iam_service_specific_credential

Provides an IAM Service Specific Credential.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
  name = "example"
}

resource "aws_iam_service_specific_credential" "example" {
  service_name = "codecommit.amazonaws.com"
  user_name    = aws_iam_user.example.name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `service_name` - (Required) The name of the AWS service that is to be associated with the credentials. The service you specify here is the only service that can be accessed using these credentials.
* `user_name` - (Required) The name of the IAM user that is to be associated with the credentials. The new service-specific credentials have the same permissions as the associated user except that they can be used only to access the specified service.
* `status` - (Optional) The status to be assigned to the service-specific credential. Valid values are `Active` and `Inactive`. Default value is `Active`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The combination of `service_name` and `user_name` as such: `service_name:user_name:service_specific_credential_id`.
* `service_password` - The generated password for the service-specific credential.
* `service_user_name` - The generated user name for the service-specific credential. This value is generated by combining the IAM user's name combined with the ID number of the AWS account, as in `jane-at-123456789012`, for example.
* `service_specific_credential_id` - The unique identifier for the service-specific credential.


## Import

IAM Service Specific Credentials can be imported using the `service_name:user_name:service_specific_credential_id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_iam_service_specific_credential.default `codecommit.amazonaws.com:example:some-id`
```
