## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
data "aws_region" "current" {}

resource "aws_vpc_ipam_preview_next_cidr" "example" {
  ipam_pool_id   = aws_vpc_ipam_pool.example.id
  netmask_length = 28

  disallowed_cidrs = [
    "172.2.0.0/32"
  ]

  depends_on = [
    aws_vpc_ipam_pool_cidr.example
  ]
}

resource "aws_vpc_ipam_pool_cidr" "example" {
  ipam_pool_id = aws_vpc_ipam_pool.example.id
  cidr         = "172.2.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_vpc_ipam_pool" "example" {
  address_family = "ipv4"
  ipam_scope_id  = aws_vpc_ipam.example.private_default_scope_id
  locale         = data.aws_region.current.name
}

resource "aws_vpc_ipam" "example" {
  operating_regions {
    region_name = data.aws_region.current.name
  }
}
```
