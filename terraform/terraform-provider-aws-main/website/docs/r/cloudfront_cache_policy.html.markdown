description: |-
  Provides a cache policy for a CloudFront ditribution. When itâ€™s attached to a cache behavior,
  the cache policy determines the the values that CloudFront includes in the cache key. These
  values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache
  key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer. It also determines the
  default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the
  CloudFront cache.

# Resource: aws_cloudfront_cache_policy

## Example Usage

The following example below creates a CloudFront cache policy.

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudfront_cache_policy" "example" {
  name        = "example-policy"
  comment     = "test comment"
  default_ttl = 50
  max_ttl     = 100
  min_ttl     = 1
  parameters_in_cache_key_and_forwarded_to_origin {
    cookies_config {
      cookie_behavior = "whitelist"
      cookies {
        items = ["example"]
      }
    }
    headers_config {
      header_behavior = "whitelist"
      headers {
        items = ["example"]
      }
    }
    query_strings_config {
      query_string_behavior = "whitelist"
      query_strings {
        items = ["example"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name to identify the cache policy.

* `max_ttl` - (Optional) The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated.
* `default_ttl` - (Optional) The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated.
* `comment` - (Optional) A comment to describe the cache policy.
* `parameters_in_cache_key_and_forwarded_to_origin` - (Required) The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. See [Parameters In Cache Key And Forwarded To Origin](#parameters-in-cache-key-and-forwarded-to-origin) for more information.

### Parameters In Cache Key And Forwarded To Origin
