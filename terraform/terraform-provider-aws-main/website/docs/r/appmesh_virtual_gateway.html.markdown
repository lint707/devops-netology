# Resource: aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway

Provides an AWS App Mesh virtual gateway resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```terraform
resource "aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway" "example" {
  name      = "example-virtual-gateway"
  mesh_name = "example-service-mesh"

  spec {
    listener {
      port_mapping {
        port     = 8080
        protocol = "http"
      }
    }
  }

    Environment = "test"
  }
}
```

### Access Logs and TLS

```terraform
resource "aws_appmesh_virtual_gateway" "example" {
  name      = "example-virtual-gateway"
  mesh_name = "example-service-mesh"

  spec {
    listener {
      port_mapping {

        protocol = "http"
      }

      tls {
        certificate {
