# Resource: aws_appmesh_route

Provides an AWS App Mesh route resource.

## Example Usage

### HTTP Routing

```terraform
resource "aws_appmesh_route" "serviceb" {
  name                = "serviceB-route"
  mesh_name           = aws_appmesh_mesh.simple.id
  virtual_router_name = aws_appmesh_virtual_router.serviceb.name

  spec {
    http_route {
      match {
        prefix = "/"
      }

      action {
        weighted_target {
          virtual_node = aws_appmesh_virtual_node.serviceb1.name
          weight       = 90
        }

        weighted_target {
          virtual_node = aws_appmesh_virtual_node.serviceb2.name
          weight       = 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Header Routing

```terraform
resource "aws_appmesh_route" "serviceb" {
  name                = "serviceB-route"
  mesh_name           = aws_appmesh_mesh.simple.id
  virtual_router_name = aws_appmesh_virtual_router.serviceb.name

  spec {
    http_route {
      match {
        method = "POST"
        prefix = "/"
        scheme = "https"

        header {
          name = "clientRequestId"

          match {
            prefix = "123"
          }
        }
      }

      action {
        weighted_target {
          virtual_node = aws_appmesh_virtual_node.serviceb.name
          weight       = 100
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Retry Policy

```terraform
resource "aws_appmesh_route" "serviceb" {
  name                = "serviceB-route"
  mesh_name           = aws_appmesh_mesh.simple.id
  virtual_router_name = aws_appmesh_virtual_router.serviceb.name

  spec {
    http_route {
      match {
        prefix = "/"
      }

      retry_policy {
        http_retry_events = [
          "server-error",
        ]
        max_retries = 1

        per_retry_timeout {
          unit  = "s"
          value = 15
        }
      }

      action {
        weighted_target {
          virtual_node = aws_appmesh_virtual_node.serviceb.name
          weight       = 100
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### TCP Routing

```terraform
resource "aws_appmesh_route" "serviceb" {
  name                = "serviceB-route"
  mesh_name           = aws_appmesh_mesh.simple.id
  virtual_router_name = aws_appmesh_virtual_router.serviceb.name

  spec {
    tcp_route {
      action {
        weighted_target {
          virtual_node = aws_appmesh_virtual_node.serviceb1.name
          weight       = 100

## Import

App Mesh virtual routes can be imported using `mesh_name` and `virtual_router_name` together with the route's `name`,
e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_appmesh_route.serviceb simpleapp/serviceB/serviceB-route
```
