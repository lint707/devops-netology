# Resource: aws_amplify_app

Provides an Amplify App resource, a fullstack serverless app hosted on the [AWS Amplify Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

~> **Note:** When you create/update an Amplify App from Terraform, you may end up with the error "BadRequestException: You should at least provide one valid token" because of authentication issues. See the section "Repository with Tokens" below.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_amplify_app" "example" {
  name       = "example"
  repository = "https://github.com/example/app"

  # The default build_spec added by the Amplify Console for React.
  build_spec = <<-EOT
    version: 0.1
    frontend:
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - yarn install
        build:
          commands:
            - yarn run build
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: build
        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*
  EOT

  # The default rewrites and redirects added by the Amplify Console.
  custom_rule {
    source = "/<*>"
    status = "404"
    target = "/index.html"
  }

  environment_variables = {
    ENV = "test"
  }
}
```

### Repository with Tokens

If you create a new Amplify App with the `repository` argument, you also need to set `oauth_token` or `access_token` for authentication. For GitHub, get a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and set `access_token` as follows:

```terraform
resource "aws_amplify_app" "example" {
  name       = "example"
  repository = "https://github.com/example/app"

  # GitHub personal access token
  access_token = "..."
}
```

You can omit `access_token` if you import an existing Amplify App created by the Amplify Console (using OAuth for authentication).

### Auto Branch Creation

```terraform
resource "aws_amplify_app" "example" {
  name = "example"

  enable_auto_branch_creation = true

  # The default patterns added by the Amplify Console.
  auto_branch_creation_patterns = [
    "*",
    "*/**",
  ]

  auto_branch_creation_config {
    # Enable auto build for the created branch.
    enable_auto_build = true
  }
}
```

### Basic Authorization

```terraform
resource "aws_amplify_app" "example" {
  name = "example"

  enable_basic_auth      = true
  basic_auth_credentials = base64encode("username1:password1")
}
```

### Rewrites and Redirects

```terraform
resource "aws_amplify_app" "example" {
  name = "example"

  # Reverse Proxy Rewrite for API requests
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html#reverse-proxy-rewrite
  custom_rule {
    source = "/api/<*>"
    status = "200"
    target = "https://api.example.com/api/<*>"
  }

  # Redirects for Single Page Web Apps (SPA)
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html#redirects-for-single-page-web-apps-spa
  custom_rule {
    source = "</^[^.]+$|\\.(?!(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf|map|json)$)([^.]+$)/>"
    status = "200"
    target = "/index.html"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
