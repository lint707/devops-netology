# Data Source: aws_rds_engine_version

Information about an RDS engine version.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_rds_engine_version" "test" {
  engine             = "mysql"
  preferred_versions = ["5.7.42", "5.7.19", "5.7.17"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `engine` - (Required) DB engine. Engine values include `aurora`, `aurora-mysql`, `aurora-postgresql`, `docdb`, `mariadb`, `mysql`, `neptune`, `oracle-ee`, `oracle-se`, `oracle-se1`, `oracle-se2`, `postgres`, `sqlserver-ee`, `sqlserver-ex`, `sqlserver-se`, and `sqlserver-web`.
* `parameter_group_family` - (Optional) The name of a specific DB parameter group family. Examples of parameter group families are `mysql8.0`, `mariadb10.4`, and `postgres12`.
* `preferred_versions` - (Optional) Ordered list of preferred engine versions. The first match in this list will be returned. If no preferred matches are found and the original search returned more than one result, an error is returned. If both the `version` and `preferred_versions` arguments are not configured, the data source will return the default version for the engine.
* `version` - (Optional) Version of the DB engine. For example, `5.7.22`, `10.1.34`, and `12.3`. If both the `version` and `preferred_versions` arguments are not configured, the data source will return the default version for the engine.
