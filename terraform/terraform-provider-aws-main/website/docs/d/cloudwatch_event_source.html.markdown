# Data Source: aws_cloudwatch_event_source

Use this data source to get information about an EventBridge Partner Event Source. This data source will only return one partner event source. An error will be returned if multiple sources match the same name prefix.

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_cloudwatch_event_source" "examplepartner" {
  name_prefix = "aws.partner/examplepartner.com"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name_prefix` - (Optional) Specifying this limits the results to only those partner event sources with names that start with the specified prefix

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN of the partner event source
* `created_by` - The name of the SaaS partner that created the event source
* `name` - The name of the event source
* `state` - The state of the event source (`ACTIVE` or `PENDING`)
